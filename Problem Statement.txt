Problem 2: Chatbot with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Problem Statement: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an important module allowing a
Large-Language Model (LLM) to process and extract knowledge from large amounts of external
documents without finetuning it. You are asked to develop an LLM-based chatbot with your own
implemented RAG module that creates a knowledge base from documents in a given dataset.
The solution should demonstrate your understanding of document chunking, chunk embedding,
building a vector database, and vector search. The given dataset also contains sets of
questions used to test the RAG module.

The dataset consists of 4 CSV files:
1. documents.csv contains 20 documents used to build the RAG.
2. single_passage_answer_questions.csv contains a set of question-answer pairs in which
a single document is required to generate the answer
3. multi_passage_answer_questions.csv contains a set of question-answer pairs in which
several documents are required to generate the answer
4. no_answer_questions.csv contains a set of questions in which the answer is not
included in the documents.
A bonus question: To ensure the safe, ethical, and reliable use of the chatbot, you are asked
to add guardrails to reject queries that are misused or politically sensitive and to prevent
unintended outputs.

Evaluation Criteria
● Practicality and clarity of the proposed solution
● Depth of understanding in document chunking, chunk embedding, and vector database
● Effectiveness of the RAG module and the guardrails (for the bonus question)
